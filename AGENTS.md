# Project instructions

<!-- project-starter:begin -->
Project Starter manages this block; add project rules after it. Project rules
take precedence over this block and the foundation pages wherever they differ.

- Keep durable guidance and non-derivable context in [memory](memory/README.md),
  and designs, decisions, and research in [docs](docs/README.md). Before
  non-trivial work or writing memory, search with `bin/knowledge search "term"`
  or `bin/knowledge query "question" --no-rerank`, then read results with
  `bin/knowledge get <path> -l 80`. Markdown sources are authoritative.
- If configured QMD fails, tell the user immediately and attempt repair. If
  repair fails, pause knowledge-dependent work until the user approves a
  fallback; never silently substitute `rg` or direct reads. See
  [search failures](docs/foundation/knowledge-search.md#search-failures).
- Use td for work with multiple stages, interruptions, blockers, or handoffs;
  run `td usage --new-session -q` once per new context and keep handoffs
  current. See [task tracking](docs/foundation/task-tracking.md).
- Follow the [engineering policy](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md):
  fewer dependencies, red-green tests for behavior changes, flaky tests fixed
  or tracked in an issue, cohesive files and pages, checkout-isolated
  validation, and the latest stable toolchains.
- Deliver by [kind of change](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md#kinds-of-change):
  commit text, such as Markdown and AI skill prose, directly on the default
  branch without checks; commit development code, such as tests, CI, and
  tooling, directly after its checks pass; and deliver production code through
  a pull request after its checks.
- Run [checks](docs/foundation/engineering-policy.md#checks) by change: the
  relevant checks while editing, and `bin/check --full` before merging or
  releasing production code unless an enforced CI gate runs it. Reuse passing
  results.
- Keep accepted decisions separate from proposals, preserve unrelated changes,
  and keep secrets and generated caches out of Git.
- Run `bin/setup` after cloning, `bin/doctor` to diagnose setup, and
  `bin/qmd-index` after uncommitted knowledge edits. Managed files listed in
  `.project-starter.json` change only through Project Starter or a recorded
  override with its reason.

## Project

- Radio follows radio stations and builds Apple Music playlists from the
  songs they play. It is a dependency-free Swift package (macOS 26+,
  Swift 6.2+); `bin/check-application` builds and tests it, and CI cannot, so
  run `bin/check --full` locally before merging. Commands, versions, and
  deployment (`bin/deploy`) are in
  [development workflow](docs/development-workflow.md).
- Deliver finished changes without asking: once the required checks pass,
  commit to `main`, push, and run `bin/deploy` whenever the
  [development workflow](docs/development-workflow.md#deployment) calls for
  it.
- Run the CLI from a checkout with `RADIO_HOME` set to a scratch directory and
  `RADIO_ENV_FILE=/dev/null`, so it never touches the live database or sends
  alerts.
- The project is MIT licensed; keep `LICENSE` in the root.
